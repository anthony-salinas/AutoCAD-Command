# AutoCAD-Command
Written in C++ using the ObjectARX library. Commands prompt the user for an ID and will display the opening dimensions for the provided ID within the AutoCAD command line. The commands can be used by a CAD designer to get door/window dimensions without having to look them up in architectural plans.
